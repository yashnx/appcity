This particular project involves the creation of an E-commerce website from the ground up, which includes everything from designing and developing the website to deploying it. The development of the website has been carried out using the Django framework, while the frontend has been created using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

In addition to the aforementioned details, this project showcases an E-commerce website that specializes in selling electronics. The website has an extensive database that includes approximately 100 listed products, each with its own detailed description and specifications.

The website features a user-friendly interface that enables customers to browse through the products effortlessly and make purchases with ease. It also includes advanced search and filtering options, allowing customers to find products based on specific criteria such as brand and product type.

Moreover, the website also includes features such as a shopping cart which are essential for any E-commerce website. 

During the development process, the database utilized was dbsqlite3. However, for the deployment phase, Heroku's free postgresql (previous version now closed due to change in pricing) was employed as the preferred database. Overall, this project showcases a comprehensive approach to building an E-commerce website that covers everything from the coding to the deployment stage.
